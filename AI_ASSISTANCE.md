# AI Assistance Disclosure

The ASSIS project was developed with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence tools,
used in different and clearly distinguished roles.

## Conversational AI Support

Conversational AI systems (such as ChatGPT) were used as a collaborative aid for:

- Architectural discussions and design reasoning
- C4 and UML diagram modeling
- Exploration of alternative interpretations and abstractions
- Documentation drafting and revision
- Pedagogical reflection and explanation

These tools were used outside the code editor, in a dialog-based and reflective manner,
supporting decision-making rather than directly generating code.

## Programming Assistance Tools

The project may also be developed using conventional programming assistance tools
(e.g., code completion, static analysis, IDE support).

However, conversational AI was not used as an inline code generator or autonomous
programming agent.

## Responsibility and Authorship

All architectural decisions, interpretations, and final implementations remain the
responsibility of the project author.
