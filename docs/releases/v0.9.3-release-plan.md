# ASSIS v0.9.3 – Release Plan

> Status: Draft / In Progress  
> Baseline: ASSIS v0.9.3  
> Last updated: 2026-01-07

This document describes the concrete steps to release **ASSIS v0.9.3**.
It is intentionally procedural and pragmatic.  
Testing strategy and execution are documented separately.

---

## 1. Scope and Intent

ASSIS v0.9.3 is released **as is**, with the following acknowledgements:

- `PlantUMLWriter` is still in transition.
- Static analysis tools (e.g. Sonar) may report outstanding issues.
- The goal of this release is **distribution, feedback, and evidence collection**, not feature completeness.

No new features are added specifically for this release.

---

## 2. Preconditions

Before starting the release:

- Working tree **must be clean**
- All modules must build consistently in the monorepo
- Java and Maven versions must be known and reproducible

From the monorepo root is the current folder, ASSIS parent folder:

```bash
pwd
```

If it is not, `cd` to the parent folder before proceeding.

Verify that the area is clean and tests are green.

```bash
git status
mvn -q clean test
```

CI signal (informational gate):
This project has no standalone build/test workflow.
Build and test steps are executed as part of the CodeQL and Sonar GitHub Actions.
	•	If the overall workflow is green, proceed.
	•	If the overall workflow is red, inspect the logs:
	•	If the failure is in build or tests, stop the release.
	•	If the failure is only in CodeQL or Sonar analysis, proceed for v0.9.3.
	
If they are not, **stop** and investigate before proceeding.

---
## 3. Tag Safety Check (Pre-release)

Before changing any versions, verify that the release tag does not already exist
and that its format matches previous releases.

### 4.1 Inspect existing tags

Ensure tag naming matches existing conventions:

```bash
git fetch --tags
git tag --list | sort -V
```

Expected format: `vX.Y.Z`

### 4.2 Ensure tag does not already exist

Verify that the intended tag (e.g. v0.9.3) does not exist:

```bash
git tag --list v0.9.3
```

If the tag already exists, **stop** and investigate before proceeding.


## 4. Version Bump to Release Version

Use Maven to update project version inside each pom.xml:

```bash
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.9.3
mvn versions:commit
```

Commit the version bump:

```bash
git commit -am "Release 0.9.3"
```

---

## 4. Tagging the Release


Create annotated tag:

```bash
git tag -a v0.9.3 -m "ASSIS v0.9.3"
```

Verify:

```bash
git show v0.9.3
```

---

## 5. Push Commit and Tag

Push commit first, then tag:

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin v0.9.3
```

Optional sanity check:

```bash
git describe --tags --dirty
```

Expected output:

```
v0.9.3
```

---

## 6. Build Release Artifacts

From a clean state:

```bash
mvn -q clean package
```

Verify:
- CLI JAR is produced
- `assis --version` runs correctly
- No unexpected build-time failures

---

## 7. GitHub Release (Manual)

Create a GitHub Release for tag `v0.9.3`.

Actions:
- Upload release artifact (JAR): `assis-cli-0.9.3.jar`
- Add release notes as bellow:
Release artifacts:
- assis-cli-0.9.3.jar

Release notes as bellow:

- Scope:
  - Added explicit type and package closing tags to ease UNIX tools slicing and dicing.
  - ASSIS CLI now supports a `-sourcepath` list parameter.
  - ASSIS CLI uses a logger for all messages.
  - ASSIS CLI `--version` reports dependencies and OS information.
- Known limitations:
  - Dependencies between types are not rendered.
  - Type rendering development is ongoing, driven by parse-and-sample needs.
  - Type association unwrapping is ongoing, driven by parse-and-sample needs.
- Testing:
  - See `docs/releases/v0.9.3-test-plan.md`
  
Do **not** include large test artifacts here unless explicitly intended

Check logs after the v0.9.2 tag for additional scope, if needed.

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## 8. Post-Release: Bump to Next SNAPSHOT

Immediately after release, reopen development:

```bash
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.9.4-SNAPSHOT
mvn versions:commit
```

Verify:

```bash
mvn -q clean verify
```

Commit and push:

```bash
git commit -am "Bump version to 0.9.4-SNAPSHOT"
git push origin main
```

---

## 9. Continuous Integration Check

After pushing the SNAPSHOT bump:

- Review GitHub Actions runs
- Investigate any failures immediately
- Pay special attention to:
  - dependency resolution
  - version mismatches
  - Java version configuration

---

## 10. Out of Scope

Explicitly out of scope for this release:
- Feature testing
- Performance optimization
- Static analysis cleanup
- Large-scale refactoring

These concerns are tracked separately.
