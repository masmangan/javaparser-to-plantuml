# ASSIS v0.9.3-beta – Test Plan (assis-core)

> Status: Draft  
> Baseline: ASSIS v0.9.3-beta
> Last updated: 2026-01-11

This document describes the **manual test plan** for ASSIS v0.9.3, using assis-core as a typical Maven repository to be scanned.

It focuses on *evidence-based execution* rather than feature validation.

This plan is intentionally pragmatic and scoped to validate that ASSIS can be
executed, produces artifacts, and behaves consistently when facing Maven folder naming conventions.

Note:
This baseline procedure assumes execution from within the project directory.
The ASSIS CLI JAR may reside in a different folder; however, path-resolution behavior related to JAR location is not exercised in this phase and is covered separately in Appendix A.

---

## 1. Test Objectives

The objectives of this test plan are to:

- Validate that ASSIS CLI can be executed independently of an IDE
- Generate UML diagrams from a typical Java repository using Maven folder layout
- Collect **hard evidence** (logs, screen recordings, artifacts)
- Identify blocking failures and unexpected behavior
- Establish a reproducible baseline for future releases

This is **not** a feature-completeness test.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- ASSIS CLI execution using the released v0.9.3-beta JAR
- Diagram generation from a selected Java repository
- Logging, diagnostics, and exit behavior
- PlantUML rendering sanity checks
- Handling of a simple Maven repository

### Out of scope

- Feature validation or correctness proofs
- Performance benchmarking
- Static analysis cleanup (Sonar, CodeQL)
- Exhaustive test coverage
- IDE plugin testing

---

## 3. Test Evidence Strategy

Each test execution should produce:

- A **screen recording** (Zoom, Quicktime or similar tool) showing:
  - `assis --version`
  - command-line execution
  - diagram rendering
- Captured **logger outputs**
- Generated `.puml` files (compressed as `.zip`)

Artifacts are uploaded as:
- GitHub Release assets (preferred for large files)
- Or linked from GitHub Issues if small

---

## 4. Stop Conditions

Stop the test plan execution immediately if:

- ASSIS cannot render ASSIS itself
- ASSIS fails to start or crashes on a minimal input
- Reproducible fatal errors occur early in execution
- Output artifacts are not generated

When stopping:
- Record logs and video evidence
- Open a GitHub Issue describing the failure
- Reference this test plan and the execution issue

---

## 5. Test Environment

### 5.1 Workspace Setup

We expect bash, git, JDK, plantuml to be installed.

Check that the folder does not exist.

```bash
ls assis-0-9-3-test
```

If the folder already exist, delete it before proceeding.

Create the folder and change directory.

```bash
mkdir -p assis-0-9-3-test
cd assis-0-9-3-test
```

Make sure the folder is empty before proceeding.

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

### 5.2 Download ASSIS CLI Artifact

```bash
curl -L -o assis-cli.jar https://github.com/masmangan/assis/releases/download/v0.9.3/assis-cli-0.9.3-beta.jar
```

Verify version:

```bash
java -jar assis-cli.jar --version
```

We expect the jar to run and version v0.9.3.

## 6. Test Procedure 


### 6.1 Start Recordings

Create an issue for this procedure.

Log any comment, observation, or deviation in the issue during execution.
Capture screen shots, save issue comments frequently.


### 6.2 Clone and change directory

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/masmangan/assis.git
```

Change directory to assis:

```bash
cd assis
cd assis-core
```

Check we have .java files to scan:

```bash
pwd
find src/main/java -name "*.java" | head
```

Check we have some .java files.


### 6.3 Run ASSIS Smoke test

Check jar:

```bash
java -jar ../../assis-cli.jar --version
```

Check the jar is running and version info is displayed.

Baseline smoke test:
The following execution validates that the ASSIS engine starts and produces output using default settings. It does not assert correctness of source resolution.

Autoscan behavior is exercised only as part of the smoke test and is not considered a correctness guarantee.


Run:

```bash
java -jar ../../assis-cli.jar
```


Check logs for errors, SEVERE level logs, and writing file location.

If this step fails, stop execution and report an engine startup or default-resolution failure.


### 6.4 Diagram Inspection

Generate a diagram image and open it:

```bash
plantuml --svg class-diagram.puml
open class-diagram.svg
```


Verify:
- Diagram renders successfully
- Diagram has types
- Relationships and packages are plausible
- Warnings or notes are understandable

Interpretation: A successful smoke test run indicates the JAR does not need to be in the current directory for ASSIS to work in a standard Maven layout. 

# 7 Run Path Resolution Tests (Jar outside, source below)

This section validates additional path-resolution scenarios (jar outside + sourcepath to subfolder + output isolation).

Run from assis parent folder and verify that:
	•	relative -sourcepath is resolved against CWD
	•	output goes to -d relative to CWD
	•	produced diagram contains types (not boilerplate-only)

This is exactly the test that caught the regression.  

## Move to parent folder

Testing starts one folder up:

```bash
cd ..
pwd
ls
```

Check current directory is assis parent folder and assis-core is right below:

Check where the jar is:

```bash
ls -la ../assis-cli.jar
```

Proceed if the relative path finds the jar file.


## -d . resolution, source below, explicit

```bash
mv class-diagram.puml class-diagram-base.puml
java -jar ../assis-cli.jar -sourcepath assis-core/src/main/java -d .
```

Check class-diagram.puml as instructed at 6.4 Diagram Inspection

## -d out1 resolution, source below, explicit

```bash
rm -rf out1 && mkdir -p out1
java -jar ../assis-cli.jar -sourcepath assis-core/src/main/java -d out1
```

Check out1/class-diagram.puml as instructed at 6.4 Diagram Inspection

## -d out2 resolution, folder must be created, source below, explicit

```bash
java -jar ../assis-cli.jar -sourcepath assis-core/src/main/java -d out2
```

Check out2/class-diagram.puml as instructed at 6.4 Diagram Inspection

## -d . resolution, source below, src is one level down (Test plan v0.9.3 failure)

```bash
cd ..
java -jar ../assis-cli.jar -sourcepath assis-core  -d .
```

Check class-diagram.puml as instructed at 6.4 Diagram Inspection


Close issue.

Save folder contents.
