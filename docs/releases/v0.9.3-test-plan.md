# ASSIS v0.9.3 – Test Plan

> Status: Draft  
> Baseline: ASSIS v0.9.3  
> Last updated: 2026-01-07

This document describes the **manual test plan** for ASSIS v0.9.3.
It focuses on *evidence-based execution* rather than feature validation.

This plan is intentionally pragmatic and scoped to validate that ASSIS can be
executed, produces artifacts, and behaves consistently across real-world code bases.

---

## 1. Test Objectives

The objectives of this test plan are to:

- Validate that ASSIS CLI can be executed independently of an IDE
- Generate UML diagrams from typical Java repositories
- Collect **hard evidence** (logs, screen recordings, artifacts)
- Identify blocking failures and unexpected behavior
- Establish a reproducible baseline for future releases

This is **not** a feature-completeness test.

---

## 2. Scope

### In scope

- ASSIS CLI execution using the released v0.9.3(-beta) JAR
- Diagram generation from selected Java repositories
- Logging, diagnostics, and exit behavior
- PlantUML rendering sanity checks
- Handling of large and diverse code bases

### Out of scope

- Feature validation or correctness proofs
- Performance benchmarking
- Static analysis cleanup (Sonar, CodeQL)
- Exhaustive test coverage
- IDE plugin testing

---

## 3. Test Evidence Strategy

Each test execution should produce:

- A **screen recording** (Zoom, Quicktime or similar tool) showing:
  - `assis --version`
  - command-line execution
  - diagram rendering
- Captured **logger outputs**
- Generated `.puml` files (compressed as `.zip`)
- Timing and basic repository statistics

Artifacts are uploaded as:
- GitHub Release assets (preferred for large files)
- Or linked from GitHub Issues if small

---

## 4. Stop Conditions

Stop the test plan execution immediately if:

- ASSIS cannot render ASSIS itself
- ASSIS fails to start or crashes on a minimal input
- Reproducible fatal errors occur early in execution
- Output artifacts are not generated

When stopping:
- Record logs and video evidence
- Open a GitHub Issue describing the failure
- Reference this test plan and the execution issue

---

## 5. Test Environment

### 5.1 Workspace Setup

```bash
mkdir -p assis-benchmark/repos
cd assis-benchmark
```

### 5.2 Download ASSIS CLI Artifact

```bash
curl -L -o assis-cli.jar "<release-jar-url>"
# or
wget -O assis-cli.jar "<release-jar-url>"
```

Verify:
```bash
java -jar assis-cli.jar --version
```

### 5.3 Logging Configuration (JUL)

ASSIS uses `java.util.logging` (JUL) exclusively. Logging is scoped to ASSIS packages to avoid affecting third-party libraries.

Create `logging.properties`:

```properties
.level = INFO
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = INFO
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter

io.github.masmangan.assis.level = FINEST
io.github.masmangan.assis.cli.level = FINEST

### 5.4 Convenience Aliases (Optional)

```bash
alias aassis='java \
  -Djava.util.logging.config.file="$PWD/logging.properties" \
  -jar "$PWD/assis-cli.jar" -d .'
```

```bash
alias aplantuml=' PLANTUML_LIMIT_SIZE=16384 \
plantuml --svg --nometadata docs/diagrams/src/*.puml
```

---


## 6. Standard Test Procedure (Per Repository)

Repeat the following steps for each repository under test.

### 6.1 Create Repository Folder

Start screen recording now.

Create an issue for this procedure.

Execute the procedure. 

Log any comment, observation, or deviation in the issue during execution.
Capture screen shots, save frequently.

First, create a new folder:

```bash
cd repos
mkdir <repo-name>
cd <repo-name>
```

### 6.2 Shallow Clone

```bash
git clone --depth 1 <repo-url> repo
```

### 6.3 Capture ASSIS Version

```bash
assis --version > assis-version.txt 2>&1
```

### 6.4 Run ASSIS (Capture Logs and Timing)

```bash
{ time assis -sourcepath repo; } > assis-run.log 2>&1
```


Adjust paths as needed depending on ASSIS output configuration.

### 6.6 Diagram Inspection

Generate a diagram image and opent it:

```bash
aplantuml
open class-diagram.puml
```


Verify:
- Diagram renders successfully
- Relationships and packages are plausible
- Warnings or notes are understandable

Close issue.

Stop recording now.

Save folder contents.
 
### 6.7 Evidence Artifacts

A completed test run should produce, at minimum:

- `assis-version.txt`
- `assis-run.log`
- `class-diagram.puml`
- `class-diagram.svg` 

These artifacts constitute the test evidence.

## 8. Data to Record

For each test run, record:

- Repository name and commit hash
- Repository size (files, Java files)
- Execution time
- Number and size of generated `.puml` files
- Warnings and errors
- Rendering success (yes/no)

---

## 9. Reporting

### Execution tracking

- Open a GitHub Issue titled:
  **"Execute v0.9.3 test plan"**
- Use the issue to track progress, deviations, and links to artifacts

### Final report

After completion (or stop):

- Create `docs/releases/v0.9.3-test-report.md`
- Summarize results, failures, and lessons learned
- Link to execution issue, videos, and artifacts

---

## 10. Notes

- Sonar coverage reports are informational only
- Coverage deltas may be confusing; record both overall and new-code metrics
- Environmental quirks (IDE refresh, dark mode screenshots, etc.) should be noted
